  <h1>About</h1>

  <div class="box">
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>VT Soft</strong> is a personal endeavor I started in <strong>2009</strong>, driven by a deep passion in coding and web designing. In its early days, even before the widespread availability of app stores, VT Soft aimed to be a helpful source for essential mobile applications for platforms like <strong>Nokia Symbian</strong>, and also offered live TV streaming channels. This venture reflects my long-standing interest in crafting useful digital solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CSL Calculations app, specifically designed for <strong>Cochin Shipyard employees</strong>, is a humble result of a dedicated learning and training project, rather than a commercial one. I developed this app entirely by myself using <strong>Android Studio</strong> for the APK build. The app operates on <strong>WebView technology</strong>, with its content hosted securely through <strong>Microsoft's GitHub</strong>, primarily utilizing <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. My commitment to <strong>user privacy and security</strong> is paramount: the app <strong>does not request any user permissions and collects no user data</strong>. Every available safety measure has been implemented to ensure your personal information remains absolutely private.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comprehensive calculator aims to simplify various aspects of daily life. Users can easily determine <strong>overtime pay</strong>, understand the implications of <strong>PF deductions</strong> or withdrawals, and utilize an <strong>income tax calculator</strong>. It also includes practical tools like a <strong>weight calculator</strong> and a <strong>BMI calculator</strong> for general awareness. A key feature is the integrated <strong>calendar</strong> with all <strong>CSL holidays</strong>, which I hope proves especially beneficial for contract workers who may not always have access to the official company calendar. This calendar also allows users to mark their <strong>weekly shift schedules</strong> using a two-color code and conveniently jot down their <strong>overtime hours</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My vision for this app is simply to empower individuals by making their daily calculations easier, assisting with financial understanding, and ultimately helping them to <strong>save valuable time</strong>. As an <strong>ITI-qualified Structural Fitter</strong> at Cochin Shipyard, I dedicate my limited free time to continually improving this app, and I am always working on future enhancements.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It brings me immense joy to share that, according to <strong>Google's analytics data</strong>, the CSL Calculations app has been used by over <strong>1000 users</strong>, processing more than <strong>20,000 calculations</strong> within the last six months. This truly incredible response is a significant achievement for this small project, and I extend my <strong>heartfelt gratitude</strong> to each and every one of you for this overwhelming support.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please note that the CSL Calculations app is <strong>not available on the Play Store</strong> due to the associated developer fees. As this is a non-commercial project, it <strong>contains no advertisements</strong>. For your security, please <strong>only download the app directly from my mobile number or through a direct link on my website</strong>. I kindly advise against downloading any applications claiming to be associated with VT Soft or CSL Calculations from other sources, as they may not be authentic or secure. Your feedback and suggestions are always most welcome as I strive to improve this tool.
    </p>
